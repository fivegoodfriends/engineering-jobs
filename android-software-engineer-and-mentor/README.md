# Android Software Engineer and Mentor

We are seeking the help of an experienced contractor to help us develop our Android capability in-house. We think building an Android version of our app while pairing with an engineer is the best way for us to learn. You should be comfortable pair programming, derive satisfaction from mentoring, and have deep intimate knowledge of the Android platform.

This is nominally a contracting role, but we are open to permanent full-time employment.

## About the Company

[Five.Good.Friends.](1) is a new end-to-end service that helps ageing Australians stay at home to continue living the life they love. Our helpers provide a range of services including domestic care, companionship, and yard maintenance while our engineers build the software that makes delivery of these services transparent, flexible, and efficient. We are already delivering these services to paying customers. We are lead by a seasoned team, have funding to scale our operation, and are expecting substantial growth in the coming year.

## Responsibilities

* Mentoring and upskilling engineers on the Android platform.
* Designing, building, testing, and delivering high quality, working software.
* Building internal tools to keep our operation running smoothly.
* Promoting a safe and sustainable working environment.

## Requirements

* Comfortable with pair programming and mentoring engineers.
* Idiomatic Java: Youâ€™re comfortable expressing yourself with Java and have cut your hands on most of the sharp edges in the Android SDK.
* Integrating with HTTP APIs: You know how to protect an application from a flaky network or handle an unexpected payload. You know how to be a nice client.
* Testing: You write unit tests to guide your code and integration tests to ensure everything works together.
* Build automation: You do not like doing unnecessary work so you know how to automate distribution of builds between beta testers and the Google Play Store.
* Strong interpersonal and communication skills.
* Fluent English.

## Desirables

If you have any of these things, great. If not, we are willing to teach if you are willing to learn.

* Building an RPC mechanism with WebView.
* Front end web development with Javascript, [Turbolinks](2), and Vue.
* Back end web development with Ruby on Rails.

## Rate and Contract Length

Depending on your skills and experience we are prepared to pay between $600 and $800 + GST per day for a 4-8 week contract.

## Location

Because of the pair programming requirement we think this contract should be on-site. We would consider a remote contract if you could make a convincing argument. Our office is at 179 Turbot Street, Brisbane, QLD. We overlook the Roma Street Parklands and Mount Coot-tha.

## How To Apply

Send an email with your rate, timeline, and resume to engineering-team@fivegoodfriends.com.au. No recruiters at this stage. Thanks.
