# Lead UI Designer

Five Good Friends is a new end-to-end service that curates and delivers help to ageing Australians. We know that a little help goes a long way to enabling Australians to stay at home so they can continue living life on their own terms. Help services are curated by our expert team of Community Managers and delivered by a network of Helpers. Helpers love having regular Members, and Members love having control and transparency over the help they receive. All of this is underpinned by software, and design is front and centre. We are lead by a seasoned management team, have funding to scale our operation, and are navigating substantial growth.

As our lead UI designer, you will be helping lift the aged care sector out of crisis by designing the software that bridges help between Members, the Community Managers, and the network of Helpers. You will make design a first class citizen by taking the reigns from our Product Manager and owning it as your entire focus. You are an advocate for our users, have a high benchmark for quality, and your design inspires the team to build delightful software.

We are a small, focused team, and pride ourselves on delivering value sustainably. We solve problems one project at a time. Everyone works collaboratively and we constrain ourselves to a 6-8 week project cadence cycle. We have some processes, but we recognise they are always a work in progress and are continually striving to better them. You can help us.

## Requirements
