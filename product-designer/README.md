[Five Good Friends](https://www.fivegoodfriends.com.au/)¬†is building Australia's best home care company by combining easy to use technology with specialised and caring people. We are passionate about keeping people connected to the homes, communities, and life they love. We already have hundreds of paying customers and funding to scale our footprint nationally.

- Did you know that caring intimately for someone is actually a family problem? You will help craft apps that improve transparency and give control back to our customers and their families.
- Do you believe that better decisions can be made if you combine insightful data with specialised people? You will help design the software that augments decision-making to improve customer health outcomes.
- Do you prefer to work in small, multi-disciplinary teams where you can influence change? We form small teams around one big project at a time and we collaborate through Basecamp. You should lean toward being a generalist, although there is room to specialise in the future.
- Do you think you should learn at work? We place a huge emphasis on collectively learning through experimentation, shared ownership, and working sustainably.

You will find this role appealing if you're someone who wants to focus in-depth on a single product. Our software is a modern, responsive web app and a companion iOS app used by a workforce of independent business operators, customers receiving care, families of the customers, and expert case managers who coordinate and advice. We also have plans to make a companion Android app which is one of the reasons why we would like to talk to you.

# Responsibilities

- You will own and have oversight over design at Five Good Friends. You will influence web, apps, email, and, print.
- You will conduct customer research to understand our customer's journey and ultimately how to delight them.
- You will prototype, test, and craft delightful user experiences for our Web, iOS, and Android application guided by a design system that you own and lead.
- You will guide our Engineers to build reusable user interface components and delightful interactions based on their technical input.
- You will contribute to our evolving product and its business model. We have an open pitching process and go to great lengths to make it sustainable for everyone to graze and contribute to business decisions.
- You will design user experiences in a way that keeps our users safe and you will promote a safe and sustainable working environment.

# Requirements

- You will take ideas from concept through to production for our web, iOS and Android apps. You will challenge the poor ones, sniff out the real requirements for the good ones, understand design trade-offs, and arrive at elegant, customer focused solutions.
- You are truly a master of your tools and your workflows will blow us away. You [pixel fit shapes](https://dcurt.is/pixel-fitting), carefully organise layers, and annotate flows between screens.
- Organise, slice, and prepare user interface assets for all our platforms. Blurry assets on high-density screens make you sad. Nomenclature is everything to you.
- You work better in a team and believe in the collective ownership of our user experience. You are receptive to feedback and are good at coaching others to give you constructive feedback.
- You will write good copy for the experiences you design with the help of our Product Manager.
- You will conduct research with our customers and map their user journey and you will conduct testing with our customers and iterate based on their feedback.
