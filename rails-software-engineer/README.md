[Five Good Friends](https://www.fivegoodfriends.com.au) is building Australia's best home care company by combining easy to use technology with specialised and caring people. We are passionate about keeping people connected to the homes, communities, and life they love. We already have hundreds of paying customers and funding to scale our footprint nationally.

- Did you know that caring intimately for someone is actually a family problem? You will help craft apps that improve transparency and give control back to our customers and their families.
- Do you believe that better decisions can be made if you combine insightful data with specialised people? You will help build the software that augments decision-making to improve customer health outcomes.
- Do you prefer to work in small, multi-disciplinary teams where you can influence change? We form small teams around one big project at a time and we collaborate through Basecamp and GitHub. You should lean toward being a generalist, although there is room to specialise in the future.
- Do you think you should learn at work? We place a huge emphasis on collectively learning through experimentation, shared ownership, and working sustainably.

Our product is underpinned by a monolithic Rails app powered by PostgreSQL, Redis, and Heroku. We do zero downtime deploys, have had 99.99% uptime since we launched in August 2016, and use server-side rendering combined with Turbolinks. This has enabled us to make our product available on iOS as well as the web. We have plans to make it available on Android too.

# Responsibilities

- You will have a safe environment to craft and deliver high quality, delightful software.
- You will automate repetitive tasks and you will sharpen internal tools to keep us running smoothly.
- You will mentor other Engineers by providing them with technical guidance, ideas, and feedback.
- You will occasionally need to respond to system outages after hours, but we go to lengths to make this a rarity.
- You will contribute to our evolving product and its business model. We have an open pitching process and go to great lengths to make it sustainable for everyone to graze and contribute to business decisions.
- You will keep our users safe, our product secure, and promote a safe and sustainable working environment.

# Requirements

- You will take features and bug fixes from concept through to production. You will sniff out the real requirements, understand design trade-offs, deploy it to production, and monitor it with metrics.
- You are experienced using Ruby and relational databases to model concepts with object oriented design.
- You are experienced using JavaScript to enhance interactions with HTML/CSS components.
- You have production experience maintaining a medium to large Rails codebase. You should be able to tell us what you love, and where you deviate.
- You have working knowledge of at least one other programming language. You can convince us of its utility, but caution us where it might be painful.
- You work better in a team and believe in the collective ownership of code. You are comfortable reviewing code and having your code reviewed.
- You write unit tests to guide your code and integration tests to ensure everything works together.
- You are fluent in English and have strong interpersonal and communication skills.
- You are located in Australia and have the right to work in Australia.

# Desirables

If any of these things describe you, great. If not, maybe you have other ways you can contribute?

- Integrating with 3rd party APIs. You know how to protect an application from a flaky network or handle an unexpected payload.
- Building for Android or iOS.
- Contributing to open source software.
- Instrumenting and analysing metrics with DataDog.
- Automating systems with Ansible and Docker.

# Benefits

Depending on skills and experience we are prepared to offer:

- Base salary up to $130,000 + Super.
- Laptop, keyboard, mouse, adapters, and huge display.
- Flexible, sustainable, and safe working environment.
- Extra days of annual leave over time.
- $500 health and wellbeing allowance to spend on gym membership, running shoes, cooking classes, dancing classes, or anything that you feel will help your wellbeing.
- Regular 1-on-1s with your manager.

# Location (Remote is üëç)

We've got an office in Brisbane, but you can work from anywhere in Australia.

Our Brisbane office is on Turbot Street in the CBD. We overlook the Roma St Parklands and Mount Coot-tha. We do a weekly shopping order from Coles which includes plenty of fruit and snacks.
