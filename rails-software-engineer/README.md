[Five Good Friends](https://www.fivegoodfriends.com.au) is reinventing home care. Combining easy to use technology with skilled and caring people we are building Australia’s best care company. We are raising people’s ambitions as to what they should expect from a care company. We are focused on the customer experience and believe significant change is required. We are passionate about keeping people connected to the homes, communities and life they love. We already have hundreds of paying customers and  funding to scale our footprint nationally.

We need your help to evolve our product by crafting delightful software. We organise ourselves into small, multi-disciplinary teams and collaborate through Basecamp and GitHub. We’re small, so we’d prefer you to work like a generalist, although there is room to specialise in the future. We place a huge emphasis on learning, collective ownership, and working sustainably. 

Our product is underpinned by a monolithic Rails app powered by PostgreSQL, Redis, and Heroku. We do zero downtime deploys, have had 99.99% uptime since we launched in August 2016, and leverage server-side rendering combined with Turbolinks. This has enabled us to make our product available on iOS as well as the web. We have plans to make it available on Android too.
